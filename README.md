# SuperDuo
A part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program. Added enhancements to two apps in order to make them production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget for the home screen, support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, and barcode scanning via a library.
 
## Why this Project?

Super Duo gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.
